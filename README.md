## **How Modifying the Chat Utils Prompt Can Adapt the Project**
The core behavior of QuitMate is determined by the AI prompt configured in the chat utilities file. By modifying this prompt, the chatbot can be transformed for various applications, such as:

- **Mental Health Support**: Adjusting responses to provide stress management, mindfulness, and emotional support.
- **Productivity Coach**: Offering time management techniques, habit formation tips, and motivation strategies.
- **Educational AI Tutor**: Assisting users in learning languages, mathematics, or coding with interactive explanations.
- **Healthcare Assistant**: Providing symptom checks, wellness recommendations, and general medical guidance.

By simply tweaking the AIâ€™s instructional prompt, QuitMate can be repurposed into a versatile AI-driven assistant tailored to different needs.
